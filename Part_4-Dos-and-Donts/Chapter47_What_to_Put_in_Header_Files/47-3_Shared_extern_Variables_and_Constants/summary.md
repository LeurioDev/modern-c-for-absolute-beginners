_Summary_: With shared global variables and shared constants, things are a bit more involved. First, we need to declare the shared variables and constants in the _myheaderfile.h_ file and marked them as extern. Then we need to define them only once inside one of the source files. By including the shared _myheaderfile.h_ file in both source files, we can access shared globals from any source file.
    The header file should not provide the definition, only the declaration. The source file should not contain external declaration, only definitions.
