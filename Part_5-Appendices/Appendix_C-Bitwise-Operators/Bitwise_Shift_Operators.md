# Bitwise Shift Operators << and >> #

The bitwise shift operators << and >> return the result of shifting the bits of
an integral expression to the left/right by N places. The bitwise operands have
the following signatures:

    integral_expressions << n_places - shift bits to the left by n_places

    integral_expression >> n_places - shift bits to the right by n_places
